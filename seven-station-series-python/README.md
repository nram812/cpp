# Seven-station-series-python

The seven-station series, will now run on w-nwp01.maui.niwa.co.nz as an automated script, through the account rampaln.

1. The script: bash_7_station_series.sh is automated to run on a monthly frequency. 
2. The bash script can run on another HPC account, and only requires "export statements" at the start of the script to run correctly. 
3. To use the Python CLIDB library - please see the following link - https://git.niwa.local/rampaln/python_clidb/-/tree/develop.


The Script accesses the data from the Folder: Mullan_Validation_Series.

This outlines the management of the seven-station series through the Python CLIDB Library.
